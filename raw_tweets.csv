62,I was just driving in town today and noticed that 2020.48.30 has added crosswalks and yields to its list of AP stopping locations. Slowing for yellow flashing lights is now also much smoother. I can't imagine how great these things will be with FSD beta. Tesla will own autonomy.

72,@domvose You needed Nolan to be made a permanent signing in my opinion. He was beginning to make you tick and allowed you to play your game. I believe we had to offload Fowler to bring him in which couldn't be done. Shame because you'd have been a great midfield pairing.
